Experimental device tree for Retroid Pocket 3, featuring a Unisoc T310 processor

Known issues:
- Choosing Hide Gestural Navigation Hint in SetupWizard grays out the next button for creating a password
- Retroid's GameAssistant does not work on LineageOS currently
- Parts of the UI are not controller friendly (main page of Settings app in particular)
- Default rotation orientation is portrait, when it makes more sense for it to be rotated 90 degrees by default
